# PhysicsSolver_Fxte
just a simple physics word problem solver with concepts covering upto 10th grade level **EXPECT BUGS!**

# ⚠️ Note: This is an early working version. Some bugs may exist, and inputs should be rechecked for accuracy.

## Features

- **Mechanics:** Calculates velocity, acceleration, force, and final velocity using basic kinematics and dynamics formulas.
- **Waves:** Calculates wave speed using \(v = f \cdot \lambda\).
- **Optics:** Calculates focal length using \(1/f = 1/v - 1/u\).
- **Electricity:** Calculates current using Ohm's Law \(I = V/R\).
- **Keyword based detection:** Detects the topic from user input
- **Supports multiple formulas for mechanics** automatically.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fxteduelist/PhysicsSolver_fxte.git
